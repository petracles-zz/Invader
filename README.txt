--------------- INVADER README ----------------

Description:

Invader is my first attempt at making a game
in Unity 4.3, utilizing the awesome 2D features
now available. The game is a VERY basic
SHMUP, where the player pilots a fighter ship
to ward off incoming UFO's. The player moves
around the game with WASD and shoots with
Mouse1. Both the player and all of the enemies
have one-hit to live!!

                        Good Luck!

Resources Used:

Art - I stripped and polished off unfinished sprites
from a free online source (the image file is in
the .zip).

Music - http://www.bfxr.net/ for sound FX and
http://freemusicarchive.org/genre/chiptune/ for
the game's main track.

Code - All scripts were taken and modified from
this tutorial:

Shortcomings:

This game really turned out like nothing I had
originally planned (the skiing game went down
the tubes very quickly, and then the rogue-like
followed shortly).

Anyways, I conlcuded that a SHMUP was going
to be my best angle for my first attempt at a
"finished project" using Unity. This game is
very barebones-looking, as I spent the
majority of the time (by far) working on the art
for this game (really, updating the sprite sheet
was time exhausting).
